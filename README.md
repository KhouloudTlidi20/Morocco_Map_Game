# Morocco_Map_Game
## Overview:
The objective behind this project is to get to know in a simple way the most famous Moroccan cities, the project is a sort of a game built with the help of python and some of its libraries **(turtle, pandas)**, so you are going to master some of python caracteristics while you are enjoying the process of creating the project.\
The idea of the project is: you write in english a moroccan city name that you know and if it is correct you will see it located in its place (repeat the same process until you complet the 50 cities), if you want to stop the game you write "exit", a CSV file is automatically generating to see which are the cities you need to learn.\
To play the game I am giving this link https://replit.com/@Tlidi/Morocco-Map#pyproject.toml to play it on replit which is a popular free online IDE that you can use to create your projects with very little setup.

### üìå Keywords:
	Turtle:
It is a python library provide programmers with the necessary elements to draw in the screen. It is actually built on top of¬†Tkinter, which is a more powerful, general purpose Python library for building GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces). The **turtle** module contains a lot of classes like (Turtle, Screen, etc), the Turtle Screen class defines graphics windows as a playground for the drawing turtles. These classes contain some methods to make visible changes on the screen like (shape(), title(), forward()...).

 	Pandas:
It is a Python library for data analysis. Pandas is built on top of two core Python libraries‚Äîmatplotlib for data visualization and NumPy for mathematical operations. Pandas introduced two new types of objects for storing data that make analytical tasks easier and eliminate the need to switch tools: Series, which have a list-like structure, and DataFrames, which have a tabular structure.
In this project we are going to use DataFrames.


## üîß Tools:
- Python basics
- Python IDE like (Atom, PyCharm, Visual studio Code, Replit (online IDE))

## üìú Steps to build the programme:
1. I picked a morocco map from the internet.
<img src="https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Facts-About-the-Map-of-Morocco-1024x683.jpg" width="300" height="300">
2. Get cities coordinates from the image and put them in the CSV file ("list_of_morocco_cities.csv").
3. 
3. I made some changes on the original image and remove the written cities on it.
